            >"Prior to Stratosphere Networks, we would lose hours upon hours of
            productivity in the event of a power outage or crash. We had nearly
            a half dozen of different IT providers, who were unresponsive, which
            would force us to use our own resources for IT management. If our
            server went down in the middle of the night, the controller of our
            company was called in to manually reboot. Our overall day-to-day
            infrastructure was a mess and took the focus off our profitable
            aspects and placed it on IT."
